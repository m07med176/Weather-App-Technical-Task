<h2>Daily forecast Application</h2>
- Daily forecast application is a simple application consisting of only one screen with a top bar containing a
text field accepting the city name then when the user click search app should hit api and get daily forecast
data for given city name, and cache it.

- Each day in days list should contain any ui item (itâ€™s up to you) to indicate weather description like (Rain,
Snow, Extreme etc.).
- If a user faces any failure in data retrieving app should first check if needed data exists in local cache if yes
app should display cached data and show some warning to indicate it is not accurate data, if no data
cached he should see UI represent this error and option to retry.
